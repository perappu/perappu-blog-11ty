 ### Coding Commissions
I offer personal website coding commissions for artists, writers, and other creatives! I am open to work with all kinds of creators, including artists/writers of adult content. <a href="https://perabyte.dev">Here is the main website for my coding/creative business, Perabyte.</a>

I work at a straightforward $40/hour and will give a quote based on your needs. I can create anything from a simple gallery, to a webcomic platform, a storefront/payment gateway, and more. You can expect to pay 3-4 hours minimum.

I provide shared hosting services + support at an inexpensive rate, or I can work with your hosting provider of choice.

Please contact me at my email (stokoriel[at]gmail[dot]com) or via Discord (stokori)!
