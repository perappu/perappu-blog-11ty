 ### Coding Commissions
I offer personal coding commissions for artists, writers, and other creatives! I am open to work with all kinds of creators, including artists/writers of adult content.

I work at a simple $40/hour and will give a quote based on your needs. You can expect to pay 3-4 hours minimum.

I provide shared hosting services + support at an inexpensive rate, or I can work with your hosting provider of choice.

Please contact me at my email (stokoriel[at]gmail[dot]com)!
