## Introduction
This is a guide on how to setup your Lorekeeper hosting on my Dreamhost alternative, [Perabyte](https://perabyte.dev). While I hesitate to make this setup guide an advertisement for my own service, it has some notable advantages over Dreamhost. Part of the setup is already completed for you, it is more stable than DH/cheaper in the long run, and other benefits.

If you prefer Dreamhost, some of this tutorial will still apply, although it will require some extra steps. These are detailed in some older guides for Lorekeeper.

**This second part walks you through setting up your local copy of Lorekeeper. If you have NOT set up your local, click [here](/posts/lorekeeper-setup-part-1) for part one.**

## Before You Start
- **This guide assumes you have a local copy of Lorekeeper already installed and functional.** This is REQUIRED before progressing further.
- **This guide assumes you are on Windows.** Linux and Mac have alternatives to XAMPP and different methods for SSH. Please reach out to the Lorekeeper Discord if you're on one of those operating systems.
- **Please read every step of this guide carefully,** especially because this section involves real life money. I highly recommend doing a full read-through before you even get started.
