**Hi there!** I'm Kaz, but you may see people use other names too. 

I wear many hats -- web developer, illustrator, professional software destroyer, pigeon wrangler. My main interests include liking birds and all the books you were forced to read in school.

I generally have a lot of projects all spinning around at once. You can find most of them on my website here or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/perappu).

Thanks for looking!
