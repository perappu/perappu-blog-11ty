Thank you for considering me for your developer work! ❤️ I'd love to work with you. Read below for more information!

### Hosting Services

#### ✨NEW✨ Shared Hosting

I now offer an __alternative to DreamHost__ under the name Perabyte Hosting.

This hosting is an uncomplicated **$10/month** ($120 yearly) and is a great option for people who would like greater performance and support than what DreamHost offers, but still wish to manage their own code. 

Unlike DreamHost and other hosting options, the plan will not magically grow more expensive each year -- I am committed to staying at the $10/month price point.

It comes with **unlimited bandwidth, 25 GB of storage, and free email** (no fighting Sendgrid or Mailersend required!). The environment is also **already prepped and ready for Lorekeeper** with Composer installed by default. More storage can be added at a rate of $2.00 per 10 GB.

I also provide site setups under my shared hosting for the same standard $40 rate, or you can work with your coder of choice.

While production ready and proudly hosting popular Lorekeeper sites already, guides are still in progress. Please contact me via my Discord stokori or my email stokoriel[at]gmail[dot]com if you are interested.

#### Managed Hosting

For people who prefer a more "hands-off approach" to Lorekeeper, I provide **managed hosting**. 

What does this mean? I can do *nearly everything* coding-wise for your site.

I can:
* Maintain all aspects of your hosting set up -- domain name, files, images, database, sendgrid...
* Keep your server secured
* Keep your site updated to the newest version of LK v3
* Install & edit extensions
* Turn mock-up website layouts into CSS/HTML
* Move your website to my managed hosting
* Provide general dev work for existing websites
* ...and more depending on your needs!

**If you're looking for a permanent coder to have on staff, then this what you're looking for!**

##### New Sites

Initial dev work is **$40/hour**, which will be tracked via an external time-tracking tool. **Initial site setup is a minimum of $40.** Depending on your extension choices, most sites can be set up within 2-3 hours of billable time. Vanilla site setup (no extensions) takes about an hour of billable time.

I try to be extremely fair with what counts as billable time. I will send you messages periodically throughout the development process, so you are aware exactly when and what I'm working on! I can explain as much or as little of the process as you'd like.

**Hosting starts at $30/month.** Clients will be hosted on my Hetzner server network. By default, you have unlimited bandwidth and 40GB of storage.

More storage can be added at any time at the rate of $2.00 per 10GB. Pricing is available in monthly or yearly increments.

**This is a better deal than DreamHost!** On top of hosting, the $30 per month includes:

* Basic maintenance
* Updates to LK
* Updates to extensions*
* Bug fixes (&quot;It suddenly broke and I don't know how to fix it&quot;) and other small changes (see TOS for details)

**Additional dev work after initial site setup is discounted for people I host at $35/hour.** This is as a thank you for choosing me for your hosting!

<sub>* Within reason, as some complex extensions may require additional dev time to update.</sub>

##### Existing Sites
If you have an existing LK site and would like to transfer to my services, I'm happy to help! I charge $35/hour with a one hour minimum charge. Most site transitions can be done within 1-2 hours. You will need to be comfortable providing any necessary logins -- for Dreamhost, this is usually your account and PuTTy logins. After that, you still benefit from the discounted $35/hour rate.

### General Work
I can also help with general dev work at my standard $40/hour charge. This can include adding extensions, updating your site, etc.

Depending on your idea, I can help with creation of custom extensions/features. Let me know what your idea is and we'll go from there!
