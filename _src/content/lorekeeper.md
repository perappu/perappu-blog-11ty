Thank you for considering me for your developer work! ❤️ I'd love to work with you. Read below for more information!

### Hosting Services

For people who prefer a more "hands-off approach" to Lorekeeper, I provide **managed hosting**. 

What does this mean? I can do *nearly everything* coding-wise for your site.

I can:
* Maintain all aspects of your hosting set up -- domain name, files, images, database, sendgrid...
* Keep your server secured
* Keep your site updated to the newest version of LK v3
* Install & edit extensions
* Turn mock-up website layouts into CSS/HTML
* Move your website to my managed hosting
* Provide general dev work for existing websites
* ...and more depending on your needs!

**If you're looking for a permanent coder to have on staff, then this what you're looking for!**

### New Sites

Initial dev work is **$40/hour**, which will be tracked via an external time-tracking tool. **Initial site setup is a minimum of $40.** Depending on your extension choices, most sites can be set up within 2-3 hours of billable time. Vanilla site setup (no extensions) takes about an hour of billable time.

I try to be extremely fair with what counts as billable time. I will send you messages periodically throughout the development process, so you are aware exactly when and what I'm working on! I can explain as much or as little of the process as you'd like.

**Hosting starts at $30/month.** This gets you this plan offered by Hetzner, which is both faster and more reliable than Dreamhost's basic plan:
![VCPUs 2, RAM 2GB, 40GB SSD, traffic 1 TB](/content/img/hetznerplan.png)

If you wish for a faster server, the cost per month will go up accordingly. You're free to pay for several months in advance.

**This is a better deal than DreamHost!** On top of hosting, the $30 per month includes:

* Basic maintenance
* Updates to LK
* Updates to extensions*
* Bug fixes (&quot;It suddenly broke and I don't know how to fix it&quot;) and other small changes (see TOS for details)

**Additional dev work after initial site setup is discounted for people I host at $35/hour.** This is as a thank you for choosing me for your hosting!

I currently do not provide site setup services for people looking to manage their own hosting (such as DreamHost). There's plenty of other coders out there that do, and I'd be happy to recommend some to you!

<sub>* Within reason, as some complex extensions may require additional dev time to update.</sub>

### Existing Sites
If you have an existing LK site and would like to transfer to my services, I'm happy to help! I charge $35/hour with a one hour minimum charge. Most site transitions can be done within 1-2 hours. You will need to be comfortable providing any necessary logins -- for Dreamhost, this is usually your account and PuTTy logins. After that, you still benefit from the discounted $35/hour rate.

### General Work
I can also help with general dev work at my standard $40/hour charge. This can include adding extensions, updating your site, etc.

Depending on your idea, I can help with creation of custom extensions/features. Let me know what your idea is and we'll go from there!
