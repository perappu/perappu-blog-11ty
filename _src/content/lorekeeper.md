Thank you for considering me for your developer work! ❤️ I'd love to work with you. Read below for more information!

### Hosting Services

#### ✨NEW✨ Shared Hosting

I now offer an __alternative to DreamHost__.

This hosting is an uncomplicated **$10/month** ($120 yearly) and is a great option for people who would like greater performance and support than what DreamHost offers, but still wish to manage their own code. 

Unlike DreamHost and other hosting options, the plan will not magically grow more expensive each year -- I am committed to staying at the $10/month price point.

It comes with **unlimited bandwidth, 25 GB of storage, and free email** (no fighting Sendgrid or Mailersend required!). The environment is also **already prepped and ready for Lorekeeper** with Composer installed by default. More storage can be added at a rate of $2.00 per 10 GB.

**This is for people who are comfortable with coding their own site. I do not offer permanent coder services under the shared hosting.**

While production ready and proudly hosting popular Lorekeeper sites already, guides are still in progress. Please contact me via my Discord stokori or my email stokoriel[at]gmail[dot]com if you are interested.

#### Managed Hosting

For people who prefer a more "hands-off approach" to Lorekeeper, I provide **managed hosting**. 

What does this mean? I can do *nearly everything* coding-wise for your site.

I can:
* Maintain all aspects of your hosting set up -- domain name, files, images, database, sendgrid...
* Keep your server secured
* Keep your site updated to the newest version of LK v3
* Install & edit extensions
* Turn mock-up website layouts into CSS/HTML
* Move your website to my managed hosting
* Provide general dev work for existing websites
* ...and more depending on your needs!

**If you're looking for a permanent coder to have on staff, then this what you're looking for!**

**Hosting starts at $30/month.** Clients will be hosted on my Hetzner server network. By default, you have unlimited bandwidth and 40GB of storage.

More storage can be added at any time at the rate of $2.00 per 10GB. You can pay in monthly or yearly increments.

**Additional dev work after initial site setup is discounted for people I host at $35/hour.** This is as a thank you for choosing me for your hosting!

These are the services covered by managed hosting:

* Basic maintenance
* Updates to LK
* Updates to extensions*
* Bug fixes (&quot;It suddenly broke and I don't know how to fix it&quot;) and other small changes (see TOS for details)

<small>* Within reason. Some extensions are very large and may take additional dev time and/or compatibility patches to update.</small>

#### Which Hosting is Best for Me?

| Shared Hosting is best for...                                                                          | Managed Hosting is best for...                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| - People who are comfortable working with PHP | - People who don't want to worry about code             |
| - People who can be their own permanent coder                                                          | - People who need a permanent coder                     |
| - People who can run their own local environment on their own computer                                 | - People who don't have powerful home computers/laptops |

To summarize: You **will need to run your own code for shared hosting**, but there are **no requirements for managed hosting**.

### Setup Services

I provide setups either on Hetzner or for either of my hosting options. I do not do Dreamhost setups. 

#### New Sites

Initial set up is a flat **$40.** This comes with no extensions.

Extensions can be added during site setup at **$40/hr**. Depending on your extension choices, most sites can be set up within 2-3 hours of billable time.

I try to be extremely fair with what counts as billable time. I will send you messages periodically throughout the development process, so you are aware exactly when and what I'm working on! I can explain as much or as little of the process as you'd like.

#### Existing Sites
If you have an existing LK site and would like to transfer to my hosting services, I'm happy to help! I charge $40/hour with a one hour minimum charge. Most site transitions can be done within 1-2 hours. You will need to be comfortable providing any necessary logins -- for Dreamhost, this is usually your account and PuTTy logins.

### General Work
I can also help with general dev work at my standard $40/hour charge. This can include adding extensions, updating your site, etc.

Depending on your idea, I can help with creation of custom extensions/features. Let me know what your idea is and we'll go from there!
